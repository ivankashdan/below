# A Home Below - Prototype [Scripts Only]

I am a co-founder of Hermit House. A Home Below is our first commercial game. 9 months of development has resulted in a demo we are showing to publishers, which we have showcased at EGX, PG Connects and London Game Festival.

The core experience of A Home Below is a 3rd person platformer, where you play as a hermit crab exploring the environment of an underwater house. This has involved building my own custom physics system, procedural animation (for 6 legs and 8 on an octopus) and creature herding mechanics. For visuals, I have built a custom toon lighting model, dynamic grass shader, caustics, and bubble particles. For UI, I built a custom text reader and bestiary interface. For music and SFX a playback system. 

These systems function on both console controllers and PC. We are aiming for a mid-2026 release of the full game.
