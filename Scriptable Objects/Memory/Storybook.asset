  text: "[The Story of Cantre'r Gwaelod]>The feast in the castle that night was held
    in honour of Sir Seithenyn, a great knight, and the honoured guard of the sluice
    gates that locked the gap in the great sea wall and protected the fair lands
    of Cantre'r Gawelod from the sea.>Everyone raised their cups in cheers. That
    is, everyone except Seithenyn himself, who had drunk so much wine and danced
    for so much of the night that he was fast asleep at the table.>\"The poor fellow!\"
    The Queen said. \"I think he's been dancing and drinking since the first bell
    was rung.\" \"That can't be!\" One of the knights cried. \"If he was here since
    the start, then who closed the gates before high tide?\"/Everyone looked to the
    doors, and the players stopped playing. In the silence, a great howling and lashing
    of rain could be heard, and the bells in the distance were sounding the alarm.
    One of the knights flung the doors open, and a great wave of water came crashing
    in. Then the windows were smashed and the sea was soon everywhere. The hall filled
    quickly, and then it was gone./It\u2019s said when you pass over the spot in
    the sea where Cantre\u2019r Gawelod used to be, or when a storm is rolling in,
    you can still hear the bells ringing, somewhere far below. "
